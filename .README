To run this project you must ensure:
    Java JDK 8 is installed and in your path.
    Mysql is installed and its address is: mysql://localhost:3306/
    You have created a database with name: TeamCollaboration
        Can be done through mysql command prompt: "CREATE DATABASE TeamCollaboration;"
    You have a username and password in the mysql database with username "root" and with password "root"

    You have a valid IDE for spring projects: Intellij IDEA or STS Bundle [Intellij is highly recommended]

    [Note that many of these properties can be changed within the application.properties file in this spring project.

After ensuring that you have all the above done here is a step by step process:
    Navigate to the sql folder and run the TeamCollaboration.sql file in mysql command prompt:
        mysql> USE TeamCollaboration; # Selecting the proper database to run this project in
        mysql> source TeamCollaboration.sql; # Assuming you are in the sql/create-database directory
        mysql> SHOW TABLES; # Ensure that the tables were created
    Open up this project in Intellij IDEA or STS Bundle
        For Intellij:
            Run -> Edit Configurations -> + -> Tomcat Server -> Fill in information and press run button.

        For STS Bundle:
            //TODO: Documentation. I don't use eclipse so I don't know
